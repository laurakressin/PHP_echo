#Beginning PHP
As a challenge from my mentor, Scott Bromander, I'm trying to do a commit a day to challenge myself, learn new things and keep my skills fresh.

I'm starting with PHP and Wordpress as my first code base to expand.  My knowledge is limited to Wordpress, so I will expand on that knowledge and build something new.  I will be starting with Treehouse courses and working from there.

Thanks for the support and challenge Scott!
